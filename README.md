# A Manned Mission to Mars - Simulations of Transfer Trajectoriesto the Red Planet

## Abstract
Presented is a study of orbital transfers a manned mission to Mars might take
and the associated fuel costs and transfer times. A program designed to simulate
and search for these trajectories was devised and operated to provide data for five
launch opportunities in the next ten years. The results of this program have been
used along with some preliminary mass estimates to calculate the total mass of
the manned portion of the mission. The mission layout suggested involves sending
unmanned cargo vehicles ahead of the crew along an efficient trajectory to await
the crew’s arrival at Mars, the crewed vehicle will then rendezvous after travelling
along one of the more efficient routes discussed. A selection of propulsion choices
have also been discussed and their implications on the final total mass have been
considered. The report suggests the use of Nuclear Thermal Rocket engines as
propulsion for the manned portion of the mission giving the vehicle a total mass
of ≈ 200 T to be launched from Low Earth Orbit. The vehicle would likely be
constructed in orbit using multiple launches.
